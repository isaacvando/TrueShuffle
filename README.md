# True Shuffle
is a way to shuffle Spotify songs randomly, without Spotify curating the shuffle. It works by adding shuffled songs to the queue.


To build run 
```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output main.js
```

To access this app you need to be added to the list of approved Spotify accounts by me.
